/events/:slug/staff/program/sessions/new

As an organizer I want to see a form to add a new program session
Where the session title and format are denoted as mandatory fields.
I want to also be able to add a new speaker that is attached to that session
Where the speakers name and email are denoted as required fields.

Upon saving this new session I want to be redirected to a show page
So that I can look over what I've done and add other speakers.
