/events/:slug/staff/time_slots

As an organizer viewing the Schedule 'Time Slots' tab
I want to see a dynamic 'Time Slots' table that can be sorted by one or multiple columns.

I want to see both a 'Download as CSV' and a 'Download as JSON' button
So I can export this information elsewhere,
And an 'Add Time Slot' button so I can create a new time slot directly.
