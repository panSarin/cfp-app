As an organizer viewing the Schedule 'Rooms' tab
I want to see a 'Rooms' table that shows me all the information for each determined room.

I want the table to have an 'Actions' column
So that I can edit or remove any room.

I want the page to have an 'Add Room' button so that I may add a new room at any time.
