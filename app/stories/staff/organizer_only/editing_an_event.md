/events/:slug/staff/edit

As an organizer
I want to see a form where I can edit all essential details of an event
And the event name and slug are denoted as mandatory fields.

I want to be able to set/edit both the start and end dates for the CFP
And the start and end dates for the event itself.

I want to see both a 'Save' and 'Cancel' button for this form
And be redirected to the staff info page upon completion.
(/events/:slug/staff/info)
