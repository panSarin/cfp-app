/events/:slug/staff/team

As a staff member viewing the Event Dashboard sub nav 'Team' tab
I want to see a teammate info bar
With a breakdown of how many of each kind of staff member we have
And how many pending invites for each role we have
So that I know what my team is comprised of.

Below that I want to see a Team table
With a list of all teammates showing their name, email, role, and number of rated proposals.
I also want to see if they are receiving email notifications or not,
and be able to change email notifications for myself.

If I am an organizer
I also expect to see an 'Actions' column
Where I can change the role of any teammate or remove them completely.

Finally, I want to see a 'Team Invitations' table
So that I know about all pending teammate invitations.
For each invite I want to see the persons email, invite status (pending or declined),
role they have been invited to, and the time they were invited.

If I am an organizer
I also expect to see an 'Actions' column with a 'Remove' button
So that I may remove any invitations from the table.
And I should also see an 'Invite New Teammate' button
So that I may enter an email and a role and invite a new team member to participate.
