/events/:slug/staff/speaker-emails

As a staff member viewing the Event Dashboard sub nav 'Speaker Emails' tab
I want to see the templates for emails sent to speakers
when their proposal is accepted, waitlisted, or not-accepted.

I want to see a 'Preview' button for each template
So that I can look at what is currently being sent for each above proposal scenario.

If I am an organizer
I want to also see an 'Edit' button that will take me to a page where I can edit the template.
I want this page to show me markup shortcuts I can use, as well as allow me to preview the template I am editing.

I should also see a 'Remove' button so that I may remove any existing template.
