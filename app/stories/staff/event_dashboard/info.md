/events/:slug/staff/info

As a staff member viewing the Event Dashboard sub nav 'Info' tab
I want to see the event status and, if I am an organizer,
A button to edit the event and a button to change the event status
So that I may move the CFP to be open, closed, or in draft mode.

All staff members should also see:

An 'Event Information' area with event details
A 'CFP Dates' area with open and close dates
And an 'Event Dates' area with start and end dates
