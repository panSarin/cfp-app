/events/:slug/staff/guidelines

As a staff member viewing the Event Dashboard sub nav 'Guidelines' tab
I want to see the guidelines as they appear on the main event page
Just as a non-staff member would see them when they first come to visit the site.

If I am an organizer I should also see an 'Edit Guidelines' button
Which will switch the screen to an editable form where I can update and save my desired changes.
