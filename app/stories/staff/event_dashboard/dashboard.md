/events/:slug/staff

As a staff member
I want to see a sub nav with links to pages for all aspects of the current event and its team
So that I may view or manage/edit (depending on my role) these areas.

I want to see the event title as a link to the event url (if there is one)
And basic event info including date and CFP status/details.

I want to see a 'Details' area
with the event url and contact email, CFP info, and an event staff count.

I want to see a 'Checklist' area
with all event specific details that must be set before a CFP can officially open
and obvious visual clues/links to anything that still needs to be set
(links/editing only available to organizers - all other staff is view-only)

I want to see a 'CFP Statistics' area where,

** If the CFP is Open or Closed:
- shows counts and percentages of proposals, reviewed/accepted/waitlisted proposals, and scheduled program sessions.

** If the CFP is in Draft and there are checklist items missing:
- shows a disabled 'Open CFP' button and a reminder to complete checklist items in order to open it.

** If the CFP is in Draft and the checklist is complete and I am an organizer:
- shows a large active 'Open CFP' button.

** If the CFP is in Draft and the checklist is complete and I am NOT an organizer:
- shows a disabled 'Open CFP' button and a message that I must be an organizer to open the CFP.
