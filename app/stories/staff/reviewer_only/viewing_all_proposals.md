As a reviewer
I want to visit 'Review Proposals' from the nav bar
So that I may see a list of all proposals
And properly keep track of what has been rated.

I want to see an info bar with all pertinent CFP information,
Stats regarding how many proposals have been rated out of how many existing,
And how many proposals I personally have rated out of how many existing.

I want to see a dynamic table of all submitted proposals that can be sorted by one or multiple columns
So that, especially as the CFP grows, I am able to easily navigate through all proposals
Based on whatever criteria I may need to know about.
I should also see a button that will reset the sort order to its default. 

I want all proposal titles to be links to that proposals show page
So that I may easily navigate to a proposal that I may need to rate or leave a comment on.
