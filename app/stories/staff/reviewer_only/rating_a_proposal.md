As a reviewer viewing an individual proposal
I want to see an info bar with all pertinent CFP information
And the full submitted proposal with the speaker for the proposal
listed as 'Blind' so that I may review the proposal without bias.

I want to see an area for 'Public Comments'
So that I may leave comments for the speaker(s) of the proposal
In order to provide suggestions and feedback or ask any relevant questions.

I want to see a 'Review' section
With an area to record a rating that includes information about what each rating means.
After recording my rating I should see a list of what all other staff members have rated
this same proposal and what the average overall rating is.

Below that I want to see a 'Reviewer Tags' section
So that I can tag the proposal if tags have been set.
I also want to see an 'Internal Comments' area where I may leave comments for other reviewers
So that a private dialogue hidden from the proposal speaker(s) may occur.

I want to see a button that will return to me to list of all submitted proposals
And a button to take me to the next proposal show page
So that if I want to keep reviewing I may do so easily.
