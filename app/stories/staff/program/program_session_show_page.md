/events/:slug/staff/program/sessions/:id

As a staff member (program team or organizer only) viewing an individual program session
I want to see an event info bar with all pertinent CFP information
And the program session title, format, track, and abstract.

I also want to see the status of the session,
As well as a link to the original proposal (if there was one),
And a list of all of the speakers for the session with their email.

If I am an organizer
I want to see an 'Add Speaker' button so I may add other speakers to the session,
An 'Edit' button for each of the speakers so I may edit their profile,
And an 'Edit' button for the program session so I may edit the details of the session,
update its status, or delete the session altogether.
