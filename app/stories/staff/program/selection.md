/events/:slug/staff/program/proposals/selection

As a staff member (program team or organizer only) viewing the Program sub nav 'Selection' tab
I want to see a sub nav with links to pages for all aspects of the current event program
So that I may view or manage/edit these areas.
I also want the sub nav to inform me how many sessions are accepted and waitlisted
both in total and also filtered by specific tracks.

I want to see an event info bar with all pertinent CFP information
Followed by a dynamic 'Program Selection' table that can be sorted by one or multiple columns
And that includes all proposals with a status of:
Soft-Accepted, Accepted, Soft-Waitlisted, or Waitlisted

I want to see an info bar with the CFP information and a count at the top of the table of how many proposals are:
Accepted (soft-accepted plus accepted) and Waitlisted (soft-waitlisted plus waitlisted)

I want each talk title to be a link to a staff show page for that proposal:
/events/:slug/staff/program/proposals/:id

I want the table to include a 'Soft Actions (Internal)' column
So that I may either reset the proposal status to 'Submitted' or
Change the status to another soft status (only effective internally - not finalized).
