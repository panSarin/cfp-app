/events/:slug/staff/program/speakers

As a staff member (program team or organizer only) viewing the Program sub nav 'Speakers' tab
I want to see a sub nav with links to pages for all aspects of the current event program
So that I may view or manage/edit these areas.
I also want the sub nav to inform me how many sessions are accepted and waitlisted
both in total and also filtered by specific tracks.

I want to see an event info bar with all pertinent CFP information
Followed by a dynamic Speakers table that can be sorted by one or multiple columns.

I want each speaker name to be a link to a show page for that speaker
And each session name to be a link to a show page for that session.

If I am an organizer I want to see an 'Edit' button for each speaker
So that I may edit the name, email, or bio for that speaker.
