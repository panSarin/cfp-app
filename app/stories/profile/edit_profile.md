/profile

As an authenticated user
I want to see my user name in the nav bar
With a dropdown menu where I can visit 'My Profile'
So that I may edit my profile.

When visiting this page
I want to see a profile area where I may edit my name and bio
And be informed that this information is hidden from the review committee.

And I want to see an 'Identity Services' area
So that I may edit my email and password.
