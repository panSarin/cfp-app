/events/:slug

As an unauthenticated user
I want to see general information about the event and its guidelines
So that I have a complete understanding of what the event is,
what kind of proposals are being sought, how to submit a proposal,
and what will happen after I submit a proposal.

If the CFP is closed or in draft mode,
I want to see an appropriate message related to this.

If the CFP is open
I want to see how much time is left to submit, as well as a button to submit my proposal
So that I may begin the process of applying to be a speaker for the event.

I also want to see a stats area
So that I know how many other proposals have been submitted over the course of the CFP.
