/admin/users

As an admin
I want to see a 'Users Admin' table
That lists every user and staff member across all events
So that I may view or edit any user in the database.

I want this table to include the persons name (linking to the admin users page),
their email, role (if they are a staff member), OAuth type, and when they were created.

I also want to see an 'Actions' column where I can edit (/admin/users/:id/edit) or delete any user.
