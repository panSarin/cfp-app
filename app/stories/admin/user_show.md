/admin/users/:id

As an admin
I want to see the users name, email, and bio
As well as an 'Edit' button so that I can edit their info if needed.

Below that I want to see a 'Proposals' table that lists each proposal submitted by the user.
I want to see what event it was for (with the event title linking to the show page for that event),
The title of the proposal (linking to the show page for that proposal),
And the status and the abstract.

Finally I want to see a 'Participation' table
So that I can view all occurrences of this user as a teammate.
I want the table to show me every role the person held, what event it was for, and when they began this role.

(table also has an 'Actions' column that is not currently being utilized)
