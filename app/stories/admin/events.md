/admin/events

As an admin
I want to see an 'Events Admin' table
That lists every event in the database
And includes the events name (linking to its show page),
event dates, status, CFP dates, and column that allows me to archive or unarchive the event.

I also want to see an 'Add an Event' button so that I can create a new event.

/admin/events/new

I want to see a form where I can add all essential details of an event
And the event name and slug are denoted as mandatory fields.

I want to be able to set both the start and end dates for the CFP
And the start and end dates for the event itself.

I want to see both a 'Save' and 'Cancel' button for this form
And be redirected to the staff event dashboard page upon completion.
(/events/:slug/staff)
