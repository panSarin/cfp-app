/events/:slug/proposals/:id

As a speaker viewing my proposal,
I want to see a 'Speaker Information' area with a button to invite a speaker,
So that I may see a form, enter an email, click 'invite',
And see a confirmation message that tells me my invitation has been sent.

After my invitation has been sent,
I want to see the pending invite with a 'Resend' and 'Remove' button,
So that I may manage the invitation.

Once an invitation has been accepted,
I want to see the speakers name and bio with a 'Withdraw' button,
So that myself or other speakers on the proposal may be removed.
