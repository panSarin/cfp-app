/events/:slug

As an unauthenticated user
I want to click 'Submit a proposal'
And be taken to the login page
So that I can either login or create a new account
And then be taken back to the page to submit my proposal.

events/:slug/proposals/new

As an authenticated user
I want to see general info about the event in the 'info bar'
And a form to submit my proposal that includes:
All necessary fields to fully describe and pitch my proposal,
An area for my bio, a link to the event guidelines in case I need to refer back to them,
And a 'Preview' tab, so that I may view my proposal in markdown as the reviewers will see it.

I also want to see both a 'Submit' and a 'Cancel' button at the bottom of the form.

/events/:slug/proposals/:id

Upon submitting my proposal
I want to be taken to a page where I see:
A thank you message informing me that I may update or leave a comment on my proposal and when to expect a response by.,
General event info,
An 'Edit' and 'Delete Proposal' button,
My proposal status and when it was last updated,
An area to leave comments for the review committee,
And an area that shows who the speakers are for my proposal and a button to invite other speakers.
